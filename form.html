<h4> Fast Payment Application</h4>

<p>Fast payments are a payment on account for those serving personnel with significant injuries. The payment <br>
(currently £60,000) can be paid early in the person’s treatment and recovery.
    </p>

<div> 
    
    <p>A fast payment can be made if: </p>

<ul>
    <li>you are still serving in HM Armed Forces</li>
    <li>you have injuries which occurred on or after 9 May 2011</li>
</ul>
<strong>and</strong>
<ul>
<li>one or more of these injuries would, upon claiming, 
    give rise to an award between tariff levels 1-8</li>
</ul>

</div>


<p>The time limit for making an application for a fast payment is 6 months 
        beginning with the day on which the<br> injury occurs.</p>
    
    <h4>Payments under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS)</h4>
    
    <p>For serving personnel, payment will be made via Joint Personnel 
        Administration (JPA) into the same<br>account as your salary.</p>
<p> <strong> If you signed the UKSF Confidentiality Contract you must apply for Express Prior Authority from <br>
    your unit Adjutant before putting in any claim which may disclose details of your service with UKSF.
    </strong>
</p>

<p>If you need more help completing the form our Welfare Service or Helpline advisors can help.</p>
